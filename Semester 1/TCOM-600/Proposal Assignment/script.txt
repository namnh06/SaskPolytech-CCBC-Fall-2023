Henry: (finish Why Public Cloud, and using transition word to pass to Nam)
Nam: 
TRANSITION
- (3s) Thank you, Henry. 
- (3s - next slide - 3 parts Nam represent)
BENEFITS
- (15s - pause) There are multiple benefits of Public Cloud but here, we want to elaborate 3-benefit that affected to our organization.
- (30s) First, we would like to show that we could save up to fifty percent or eighteen-thousand a year when moving to cloud instead of the current solution. We estimated it carefully.
- (60s) Second thing, the Scalability, define of this is our IT department could scale up or scale down just in a blink. For example, in the holiday season ahead, for the traditional IT infrastructure, our IT department has to prepared for the increase traffic 6 months before. We had to go to the data central, worked with them in 3-6 months and through multiple paperworks - which you signed 3 months ago, Susan - to access to the building to scale up the servers. After that, we have to work with them to scale down that one too. This process costs us human resources, time, and money also. With Public Cloud, we work ourself, around a month before the season holiday only! And 1 day to scale it down immediately!
- (30s) The last benefit we want to mention here is about Accessibility. As you remember, in Covid-19 lockdown, we cannot access to the building which store our servers to maintain and upgrade in a month. At that time, our IT department has no backup solution for this because all the servers are in that building. But, if we were using the Public Cloud, or in the future, we will not meet this scenario again, EVER! Public Cloud brings the benefit to let us remote to work with the infrastructures even if we are in the vacation in Vietnam, which is 11 thousand kilometres away, on a beach, with a cocktail.
POTENTIAL CONCERNS AND SOLUTIONS
- (10s) Alright, let’s moving on to the Potential Concerns and solutions. First and foremost, it’s compliance, we are the delivery company, we are not on the list of companies mandated to ensure data security, we will use cloud computing services in the Canada region, we will adhere to all rules that might change in the future, all discussed with the Compliance Department Head, Huzma, before and we passed it all.
- (10s) Secondly, the Data Security. One point worth to mention is that the Government of Saskatchewan uses Amazon Web Services for their databases. More importantly, Amazon employs top engineers from around the world to protect all their services. If we have to protect our data on an on-premises server compared to them, it would require significant efforts and resources. Therefore, instead of relying on an in-house security team, we propose using AWS services.
- (10s) Last one, Integration Complexities, we must learn about it and find a way to migrate our IT infrastructures to the cloud. The demand for cloud engineering is booming globally. Therefore, we suggest that in-house training could benefit us more than hiring or outsourcing this one.
Other alternatives
- (15s) We want to mention 2 other alternatives here: Hybrid Cloud, and Private Cloud. (pause) Hybrid Cloud is a service where we use some parts on cloud computing and some on-premises, which leads to another problem: we have to separate resources for the same purpose. Which we do not want to step on our toes like the current solution.
- (15s) About the Private Cloud. (pause) After discussing with Amazon Web Services experts, we had to remove this option from the table due to its cost, which is even higher than what we paid for now. With this in mind, we not only pay for the cloud computing services but also have to cover the salary of a team of AWS professionals to help us operate the private cloud. We might have to reconsider these options in the future when the yearly budget of the IT department increases, or if our team cannot handle the learning curve and integration complexities mentioned before.
